# Snake Game with Java Swing

Enjoy a nostalgic gaming experience with this classic Snake Game implemented in Java Swing. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Your goal is to collect red apples while maneuvering through the grid. Be cautious not to collide with the game boundaries or the snake's own body.

Keep an eye on the scoreboard always visible at the top to track your score as you strive to achieve the highest snake length possible!
